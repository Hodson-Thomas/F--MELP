# F#-MELP : Mathematical Expression Lexer &amp; Plotter 


This project is a very basic mathematical parser and graphing calculator. I've programmed it to learn the F# programming language. It is hand-made and it is not designed to be efficient. It can process the following operators : '(', ')', '+', '-', '*', '/', you can declare ints, floats and identifiers. Feel free to download the project and test it for yourself.
